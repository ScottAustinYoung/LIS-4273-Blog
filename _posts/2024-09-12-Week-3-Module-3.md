# Welcome to Week 3's post!

Throughout this week we have reviewed the difference between descriptive and inferential statistics.
By using RStudio as a hands-on guide with descriptive statistics we were asked to input two data vectors.

And behold, our two vectors!

Now, we have to do something with these right in regards to descriptive statistics? Of course!
Through Central Tendency we will be using mean, medium and mode first for each vector.

Here we have our mean and median values for sets 1 & 2. But alas, we must now make a unique function to find our mode.
For this function I will be borrowing code that I found from a helpful tutorial website. The link is [here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/r/r_mean_median_mode.htm)

And there we have our mode for sets 1 & 2. Set1 has a mode of 2, while Set2 has a mode of 12.

Well, that was pretty easy to go through right? Next up we have to find the range, interquartile, variance, and standard deviations.

In order of how they were performed, we have the following functions: Range, Quantile, Variance, and Standard Deviation.

And now to make sense of the data at hand. When looking at the results for each vector we find the following values:
|     | Set1 | Set2 |
|-----|------|------|
|Mean|4|14|
|Median|3|13|
|Mode|2|12|
|Range|10|20|
|Quantile|0%/2.0 25%/2.0 50%/3.0 75%/4.5 100%/10.0|0%/12.0 25%/12.0 50%/13.0 75%/14.5 100%/20.0|
|Variance|72.16878|20.61965|
|Standard Deviation|2.886751|2.886751|
