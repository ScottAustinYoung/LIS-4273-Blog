# Welcome to Week 2's post!

This week's assignment had the class create a variable that is assigned a vector. Below is a screenshot of the environment and workspace in RStudio.

The function created is quite simply calculating the mean of the assignment2 vector. Within the curly braces the function is defined by the sum of assignment2 over the length, or number count, of assignment2.

The final output when calling myMean using assignment2 was 18.7.
