# Welcome to Week 6's post!

---
For this week's work it's all about working with Variance & Standard Deviation.
I will try working on my formatting skills to condense this week down, as last week I feel as though it would be difficult for a reader to follow.

A. The mean of the housemates ice cream purchases is 11.8.
B. The random sample of 2 out of the 5 members came out to be 10 & 14.
C. The mean of my sample is 12. the standard deviation of my sample is 2.828427.
D. The mean of my sample is slightly larger than that of the overall population. This is clearly due to the fact that the random sample resulted in fairly high values within the population.
   Due to the nature of having more overall values in the vector, the population has a higher deviation. This results in more variability than that of the sample.

1. Using the Central Limit Theorem we can determine Whether or not the sample proportion p has an approximate normal distribution.
   One way to check is to see if the sample size is large enough to apply. This is done through the forumla n*p≥10 & n * (1-p)≥ 10.
   The end result is that we are left with 95 & 5. Since the lower end of the formula is not greater than or equal to 10 the condition is not fulfilled. It does not have a normal distribution.
2. Since we are left with 0.05 from the population proportion, we can use this to find the minimum value for a normal distribution. The Central Limit Theorem determines a value of 10 or greater for a normal distribution.
   So, by inserting the following formula we can find the lowest value needed on the low-end of the CLT.
   0.05n = 10
   n = 200

1. The rbinom() function allows for a true random sample to be used, and returns the number of successes from the function. The arguments within the rbinom() function lets the user describe not only a specificed vector but also values such as overall sample sizes and probability of success. However, the sample() function requires a pre-determined and specified vector to work and cannot produce a "true" random value. Using rbinom() also is more ideal in producing a binary outcome, as there is either a pass or fail result. If you were to use sample() on vector it could return a whole host of results that is only constrained by the size argument.
