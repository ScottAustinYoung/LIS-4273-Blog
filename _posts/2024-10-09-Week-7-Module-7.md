# Welcome to Week 7's post!

For Module 7's work our class was given a lecture on regression analysis. In addition to the lecture, there was a helpful reading section on key terms that explains the topic easier, and in the context of R.  

The questions in which were posed to the class this week are as follows:

1.1 By using the lm() function I can demonstrate the relationship between the predictor variable X and the response variable Y.

Here I am simply defining the assigned vectors to x & y, then using those vectors within the lm() function to define a model variable.  
1.2 Now for calculating the coefficients it is simply completed through the summary() function. As shown below, the coefficients are roughly 19.206 for the intercept & 3.269 for the slope from this data.

2.1 For this question we simply define the predictor variable discharge as X & the response variable waiting as Y.
