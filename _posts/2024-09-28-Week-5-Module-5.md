# Welcome to Week 5's post!

For this week's work our class focused on hypothesis testing & correlation analysis.
These tests involved finding statistical means for populations, statistical signifigances, and two-tailed tests.

Starting with Question 1 below:

A. The Null Hypothesis H0 for this scenario is the mean breaking strength of the cookies at 70 lbs.
B. There is not enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis at a 0.05 signifigance level, as the p-value is 0.07186.

C. Since the p-value is at 0.07186 it is greater than the signifigance level of 0.05. The result of this is that the difference between the sample mean and population mean is due to random factors.
D. By lowering the standard deviation to 1.75 lbs it also lowers the p-value accordingly. The result is that we reject the null hypothesis.

E. By lowering the sample mean from 69.1 to 69 it has a signifigant enough of an effect to adjust the p-value in a way that causes us to reject the null hypothesis.

Question 2:

First I have to fill out the various variables relevant to this question in order to find the confidence intervals.

In order to find the Z-score for this question I had used the qnorm() function. Next, the margin of error was found using a formula.
The end result was that the confidence interval for this question is 83.04% - 86.96%.
