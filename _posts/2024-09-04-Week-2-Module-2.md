# Welcome to Week 2's post!

This week's assignment had the class create a variable that is assigned a vector. Below is a screenshot of the environment and workspace in RStudio.

The function created calculates the mean of the assignment2 vector. Inside the curly braces, the function is defined as the sum of the assignment2 vector divided by its length, or number of elements in assignment2.

The final output when calling myMean using assignment2 was 18.7.
