# Welcome to Week 4's post!

For this weeks assignments it's all about probability. First, we have to make a chart to use in our calculations.
I have opted in using RStudio for this assignment so as to give myself as much practice as possible.

Here we have our simple chart of just four values! Next, we must find various probabilities as listed below.

After reading through the instructions for each probability, I have inputted them into RStudio.

A1. .3333...
A2. .3333...
A3. .5555...
A4. P(A or B) =/= P(A) + P(B)

Well that was fairly simply to work through. The next step involves using the Bayes' Theorem.
Below are the instructions, and then I will begin work on each step.

B1. The answer given at the end of the prompt is false.
B2. This is due to the fact that the calculation is taking into account a wedding of an entirely unrelated person to Jane's wedding.
As a result, the calculation is inherently wrong as it is finding the probability of rain for Marie's wedding.

For the final assignment, we are tasked with finding the probability of consecutive successes for an operation.
Below are the instructions so that we may get started on calculating the results.

The result for this calculation is 1.024e-7 or 0.0000001024 in standard notation. This equates to a 0.000001024% chance that there will be 10 consecutive successes at a base frequency of 20%.
