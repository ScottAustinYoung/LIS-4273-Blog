# Welcome to Week 6's post!

---
For this week's work it's all about working with Variance & Standard Deviation.
I will try working on my formatting skills to condense this week down, as last week I feel as though it would be difficult for a reader to follow.


A. The mean of the housemates ice cream purchases is 11.8.
B. The random sample of 2 out of the 5 members came out to be 10 & 14.
C. The mean of my sample is 12. the standard deviation of my sample is 2.828427.
D. The mean of my sample is slightly larger than that of the overall population. This is clearly due to the fact that the random sample resulted in fairly high values within the population.
Due to the nature of having more overall values in the vector, the population has a higher deviation. This results in more variability than that of the sample.
