# Welcome to Week 1's post!

---

This is an initial post in order to set up my blog for LIS 4273. I have spent quite a bit of time reading through tutorials on how to use GitHub in conjunction with Jekyll.
So, think of this blog post as a sort of "Hello, World!" for me. In the coming weeks there will be a lot of trial and error in formatting my posts.
Hopefully this semester in Fall of 2024 treats you all well.
